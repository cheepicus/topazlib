VERBS

Common object-manipulation verbs are written as files in /verbs.

By id()ing to a noun, an object can be targeted by these verbs. For example,
if a room wants to have a painting on the wall to look at, it can id to
"painting" (i.e. id("painting") returns nonzero). But then the player can
try to "get painting" as well, and obviously this should not result in
the player trying to add the entire room to their inventory.

What happens in that case is the get verb calls get(string id) in the object
it has targeted, where 'id' is what the player typed to single it out.

Need a sub object like:
	add_feature("painting",
		"It is a lovely painting of a horse.",
		"It is firmly attached.");
	add_feature("horse",
		"It looks healthy and energetic.",
		"It's part of the painting!");
